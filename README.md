# NumPy Colab Notebook

This repository contains a Colab notebook designed to demonstrate the basics and applications of **NumPy**, a powerful Python library for numerical computations. Whether you're new to NumPy or looking for examples to strengthen your skills, this notebook is a great starting point.

## Features

- Introduction to NumPy
- Creating arrays and performing operations
- Indexing, slicing, and reshaping arrays
- Mathematical and statistical operations
- Broadcasting and vectorization
- Practical examples for data science and machine learning

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to explore the notebook:

### 1. Open in Google Colab

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries: `numpy`

Install NumPy using pip if not already installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
